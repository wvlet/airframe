AirSpec
======

[AirSpec](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/tree/master/airspec) is a new functional testing framework for Scala and Scala.js.

AirSpec uses pure Scala functions for writing test cases. This style requires no extra learning cost if you already know Scala. For advanced users, dependency injection to test cases and property-based testing are supported optionally.
