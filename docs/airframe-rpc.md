Airframe RPC is a framework for building RPC services by using Scala as a unified RPC interface between servers and clients.

![overview](../img/airframe-rpc/rpc-overview.png)

## Why Airframe RPC?

Airframe RPC enables calling Scala methods at remote servers. You don’t need to worry about how to encode your data into JSON, nor how to define HTTP REST endpoints. Airframe RPC abstracts away these details; the framework generates code for serializing your data objects into JSON or MessagePack and calls appropriate HTTP endpoints on your behalf.

While [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) has been a popular approach for building RPC services, it's built around [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) technology for defining data structures and RPC methods. This means, you and your collaborators need to use Protobuf ecosystem almost for everything to enjoy the benefits of gRPC. And also, gRPC heavily uses HTTP/2 features, some of them are not supported in web browsers, so if you need to write web applications using gRPC, an additional proxy like [gRPC-Web](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/web/basics/) is required.

In 2020, [Scala.js, which can compile Scala code into JavaScript, finally became 1.0.0 after 7 years of development](https://www.scala-js.org/news/2020/02/25/announcing-scalajs-1.0.0/). This has paved a way for using Scala both for server (Scala JVM) and client (Scala.js) implementations. We explored an approach for using Scala's functional interfaces as RPC endpoint definitions, and successfully created Airframe RPC on top of [technology stack of 20+ Airframe modules](index.md).

Although Airframe RPC is a relatively new project started at March 2020 inside [Arm Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com/), this project has proved various advantages. For example:

- __Free from REST__. We can just use Scala's functional interface for defining servers. [Google's REST API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design) has been useful resources for defining clear REST API endpoints, but we've found using programming language's native interface is much easier. 
- __No more web-framework wars__. In Scala, there are many web frameworks, such as [Finatra](https://github.com/twitter/finatra), [Finch](https://github.com/finagle/finch), [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html), and our own [airframe-http](airframe-http.md), etc. Each of them has its own pros and cons, and choosing one of them has been a hard choice for us. Now, we can just start from Airframe RPC using plain Scala interfaces. If necessary, we can use airframe-http for adding custom HTTP endpoints.
- __Seamless integration with Scala.js__. Writing web browser applications in JavaScript that interact with servers is not easy. You may need to learn about the existing frameworks like [React.js](https://https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), and a lot of techniques for using them. By using Scala both for server and client code, an engineer just joined the company could write an RPC application using Scala and Scala.js in a few days.


## Airframe RPC: Overview

For using Airframe RPC, first, define your RPC service interface using regular Scala functions by adding `@RPC` annotation. 
 All public methods in this class will be your RPC endpoints. For the method arguments and return types, you can use arbitrary types (See [Object Serialization](#object-serialization) for the list of available types). To pass complex messages, you can use case classes. 

```scala
package hello.api.v1;
import wvlet.airframe.http._

// A model classe. This will be serialized into JSON or MessagePack 
case class Person(id:Int, name:String)

// RPC interface definition 
@RPC
trait MyService { 
  def hello(person:Person): String 
}
```

Next, implement this service interface in Scala:

```scala
package hello.api.v1
import wvlet.airframe.http._

class MyServiceImpl extends MyService {
  override def hello(person:Person): String = s"Hello ${person.name} (id=${person.id})!"
}
```

To start an RPC web server, Airfarme RPC provides Finagle-based web server implementation.
The following code starts an RPC web server at `http://localhost:8080/`:
```scala
// Create a Router
val router = Router.add[MyServiceImpl]
  
// Starting a new RPC server.
Finagle
  .server
  .withRouter(router)
  .withPort(8080)
  .start { server =>
    server.waitForTermination
  }
```

To access the RPC server, we need to generate an RPC client from the RPC interface definition. 
We can use an RPC client `hello.api.v1.ServiceSyncClient`  generated by [sbt-airframe](#sbt-airframe-plugin), which
reads an RPC interface code and generates HTTP client code for calling RPC methods. 

Now, you are ready to call remote Scala methods:
```scala
import hello.api.v1._

// Create an RPC client 
val client = new ServiceSyncClient(Http.client.newSyncClient("localhost:8080"))

// Your first RPC call!
client.myService.hello(Person(id=1, name="leo")) // "Hello leo (id=1)!"
```

That’s it! Now you can call remote Scala methods as if they were regular Scala functions. Airframe RPC also supports asynchronous clients using Future.

## Usage

The basic flow of using Airframe RPC is as follows:

1. Define RPC interfaces with `@RPC` annotation
1. Implement the RPC interfaces in Scala
1. Create `wvlet.airframe.http.Router` by adding the RPC interface implementation classes.
1. Generate RPC client code with sbt-airfrme plugin


### Basic Project Structure

Here is an example build configurations for using Airframe RPC with Scala and Scala.js. 

[![maven central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.wvlet.airframe/airframe_2.12.svg?label=maven%20central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22org.wvlet.airframe%22%20AND%20a:%22airframe_2.12%22
) 

__project/plugins.sbt__

```scala
// For RPC client generation
addSbtPlugin("org.wvlet.airframe" % "sbt-airframe" % "(version)")

// For Scala.js
addSbtPlugin("org.scala-js"       % "sbt-scalajs"              % "1.1.0")
addSbtPlugin("org.portable-scala" % "sbt-scalajs-crossproject" % "1.0.0")
```

__build.sbt__

```scala
val AIRFRAME_VERSION="(version)"

// Common build settings
val buildSettings = Seq( 
  organization := "(your organization)",
  scalaVersion := "2.12.10",
  // Add our own settings
)

// RPC API definition. This project should contain only RPC interfaces
lazy val api =
  crossProject(JSPlatform, JVMPlatform)
    .crossType(CrossType.Pure)
    .in(file("myapp-api"))
    .setttings(
       buildSettings, 
       "org.wvlet.airframe" %%% "airframe-http" % AIRFRAME_VERSION
     )

lazy val apiJVM = api.jvm
lazy val apiJS = api.js

// RPC server project
lazy val server =
  project
    .in(file("myapp-server"))
    .settings(
      buildSettings, 
      libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        "org.wvlet.airframe" %% "airframe-http-finagle" % AIRFRAME_VERSION
      )
    )
    .dependsOn(apiJVM)

// RPC client project 
lazy val client =
  project
    .in(file("myapp-client"))
    .enablePlugins(AiframeHttpPlugin)
    .settings(
      buildSettings, 
      // Generates both ServiceSyncClient and ServiceClient (async)
      airframeHttpClients := Seq("myapp.app.v1:sync", "myapp.app.v1:async"),
      // Enable debug logging of sbt-airframe
      airframeHttpGeneratorOption := "-l debug",
      libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        "org.wvlet.airframe" %% "airframe-http-finagle" % AIRFRAME_VERSION
      )
    )
    .dependsOn(apiJVM)

// Scala.js UI using RPC 
lazy val ui =
  project
    .in(file("myapp-ui"))
    .enablePlugins(ScalaJSPlugin, AirframeHttpPlugin)
    .settings(
      buildSettings
      // sbt-airframe generates Scala.js HTTP client: ServiceJSClient with this setting:
      airframeHttpClients := Seq("myapp.app.v1:scalajs"),
      // Enable debug logging of sbt-airframe
      airframeHttpGeneratorOption := "-l debug"
    )
    .dependsOn(apiJS)
```

### sbt-airframe plugin

sbt-airframe plugins supports generating HTTP clients for making RPC calls. sbt-airframe supports generating async, sync, or Scala.js HTTP clients.

[![maven central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.wvlet.airframe/airframe_2.12.svg?label=maven%20central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22org.wvlet.airframe%22%20AND%20a:%22airframe_2.12%22
) 

Add the following plugin settings:

__project/plugins.sbt__
```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.wvlet.airframe" % "sbt-airframe" % "(version)")
```

To generate HTTP clients, add `airframeHttpClients` setting to your `build.sbt`. You need to specify which API package to use for generating RPC clients. The format is `<RPC package name>:<client type>(:<target package name>)?`. For example: 

__build.sbt__

```scala
enablePlugins(AiframeHttpPlugin)

airframeHttpClients := Seq("hello.api.v1:sync")
```

Supported client types are:
- __sync__: Create a sync HTTP client (ServiceSyncClient) for Scala (JVM)
- __async__: Create an async HTTP client (ServiceClient) for Scala (JVM) using Future abstraction (`F`). The `F` can be `scala.concurrent.Future` or twitter-util's Future. 
- __scalajs__:  Create an RPC client (ServiceClientJS)

To support other types of clients, see the examples of [HTTP code generators](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/blob/master/airframe-http/.jvm/src/main/scala/wvlet/airframe/http/codegen/client/ScalaHttpClient.scala). This code reads a Router definition of RPC interfaces, and generate client code for calling RPC endpoints. Currently, we only supports generating HTTP clients for Scala. In near future, we would like to add Open API spec generator so that many programming languages can be used with Airframe RPC.

The generated client code can be found in `target/scala-2.12/src_managed/(api package)/` folder. 


#### sbt-airframe commands
```scala
> airframeHttpReload           # Regenerate the generated client code. Use this if RPC interface has changed   
> airframeHttpGenerateClients  # Generating RPC clients manually
> airframeHttpClean            # Clean the generated code
```

### Open API

sbt-airframe plugin also supports generating [Open API](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) specification from Airframe RPC interfaces.
To generate OpenAPI spec from RPC definition, add `airframeHttpOpenAPIPackages` configuration to your build.sbt:

```scala
// [Required] RPC packages to use for generating Open API specification
airframeHttpOpenAPIPackages := Seq("hello.api")
// [Optional] Specify target directory to generate openapi.yaml. The default is target directory
airframeHttpOpenAPITargetDir := target.value
// [Optional] Additional configurations (e.g., title, version, etc.)
airframeHttpOpenAPIConfig := OpenAPIConfig(
  title = "My API",      // default is project name
  version = "1.0.0",     // default is project version,
  format = "yaml",       // yaml (default) or json
  filePrefix = "openapi" // Output file name: (filePrefix).(format)  
)
```

With this configuration, Open API spec will be generated when running `package` task:
```scala
> package
```

It will generate `target/openapi.yaml` file.

### RPC Logging

Airframe RPC stores HTTP access logs to `log/http-access.json` by default. This json logs contains 
HTTP request related parameters and RPC-specific fields described below:

- __rpc_interface__: RPC interface class name
- __rpc_class__: The atual RPC implementation class name
- __rpc_method__: The RPC method name
- __rpc_args__: The RPC call argument parameters described in JSON

These parameters can be used for debugging your RPC requests.


See also [airframe-http: Access Logs](airframe-http.md#access-logs) for more details.


### RPC Filters

Airframe RPC can chain arbitrary HTTP request filters before processing HTTP requests.
Most typical use cases would be adding an authentication filter for RPC calls:
 

```scala
import wvlet.airframe.http._
import wvlet.ariframe.http.finagle._

object AuthFilter extends FinagleFilter with LogSupport {
  def apply(request: Request, context: Context): Future[Response] = {
    val auth = request.authorization
    if(isValidAuth(auth)) {
      // Call the next filter chain
      context(request)
    }
    else {
      // Reject the request
      Future.value(Response(Version.Http11, Status.Forbidden))
    }
  }
}
```


```scala
// Router for RPC
val rpcRouter = Router.add[MyApp] 

// Add a filter before processing RPC requests
val router = Router
  .add(AuthFilter)
  .andThen(rpcRouterr)
```

### DI Integration

Airframe RPC natively supports [Airframe DI](airframe.md) for dependency injection so that you can inject 
necessary components for running your web service using `bind[X]` syntax or constructor injection. 
DI is useful when building web applications requiring many components and if you need to decouple 
component implementations from the service implementations. Airframe DI also supports switching component implementations 
between production and tests for the convenience of module tests.

Here is an example of using Airframe DI for starting an RPC server:

```scala
import wvlet.airframe._

trait MyAPIImpl extends MyAPI {
  // Inject your component
  private val myService = bind[MyService]
  
  override def hello(...) = ...
}

val router = Router.add[MyAPIImpl]

// Define the component implementation to use
val design = newDesign
  .bind[MyService].toInstance(new MyServiceImpl(...))
  .add(Finagle.server.withRouter(router).design)

// Launch a Finagle Server
design.build[FinagleServer] { server =>
  server.waitForTermination
}
```

### Object Serialization

Airframe `@RPC` interface supports almost all commonly used data types in Scala (and Scala.js). Note that some Java-specific classes (e.g., ZonedDateTime) is not supported in Scala.js. 

Here is the list of available data types:
- case classes whose parameter types (including generic types) are described in this list.  
- Primitive types (Int, Long, String, Double, Float, Boolean, etc)
- java.util.UUID 
- java.time.Instant (recommended because it can be used for Scala.js too)
  - (JVM only) ZonedDataTime, java.util.Date. These types cannot be used in Scala.js.
- Collection types: Seq, IndexedSeq, List, Set, Array, Map, Tuple (up to 21 parameters), Option, Either. 
- Exception, Throwable
  - Exception types will be serialized as GenericException for safety.
- [airframe-metrics](airframe-metrics.md) types: ElapsedTime, DataSize, Count, etc.
- Raw Json, JSONValue, MsgPack values.
- Enum-like case object class, which has `object X { def unapply(s:String): Option[X] }` definition. String representation of enum-like classes will be used. Scala's native Enumeration classes are not supported.



Airframe RPC internally uses [schema-on-read functionality of airframe-codec](airframe-codec.md) for serializing messages between server and clients. Even if the data type is slightly different from the target type, for example, if the input data is "100", but the target type is Int, the input String "100" will be translated into an Int value `100` automatically.


### Receiving Raw HTTP Responses

If you need to manage HTTP request specific parameters (e.g., HTTP headers), you can add request object to the RPC arguments.

```scala
import wvlet.airframe.http._
import wvlet.airframe.http.HttpMessage.{Request, Respone}

@RPC
trait MyAPI {
  def rpc1(p1:String, p2:Int, request:Request): Response
}
```

### Other Tips 

Airframe RPC is built on top of Airframe HTTP framework. See [Airframe HTTP documentation](airframe-http.md) for the other features and advanced configurations. 


## Airframe gRPC

_(This is an experimental feature available since Airframe 20.8.0)_

Airframe gRPC is a gRPC and HTTP2-based implementation of Airframe RPC, which can make thousands of RPC calls per second. With Airframe gRPC:   

- No Protobuf definition is required. You can use plain Scala and case classes to define gRPC service.
- Roadmap
  - [x] Create a gRPC server from Airframe RPC router
  - [ ] Generate gRPC client stub with sbt-airframe plugin.
  - [ ] Support client, server-side, and bidirectional streaming
  - [ ] Add a gRPC server proxy with airframe-http-finagle for supporting HTTP1

__build.sbt__

```scala
"org.wvlet.airframe" %% "airframe-http-grpc" % AIRFRAME_VERSION
```

### Starting Airframe gRPC Server

```scala
import wvlet.airframe.http.Router
import wvlet.airframe.http.grpc.gRPC

// Create a Router definition in the same manner with Airframe RPC
val router = Router.add[MyApiImpl]

val grpcServerDesign = gRPC.server
  .withRouter(router)
  .withPort(8080)
  .design

grpcServerDesign.build[GrpcServer] { server =>
  // gRPC server (based on Netty) starts at localhost:8080
}
```


## RPC Internals 

(_This section describes the internals of Airframe RPC protocol. Just for using Airframe RPC, you can skip this section._)

### RPC Protocol

HTTP Requests and Responses

Airframe RPC maps function calls to HTTP POST requests. Let's see how RPC calls will be translted into HTTP requests using the following RPC interface example:

```scala
package hello.api.v1
@RPC
trait MyService { 
  def hello(request:HelloRequest): HelloResponse 
}

case class HelloRequest(name:String)
case class HelloResponse(message:String) 
```

- __Method__: POST
- __Path__: `/(package name).(RPC interface name)/(method name)`
  - ex. `POST /hello.api.v1.MyService/hello`
- __Content-Type__: `application/json` (default) or `application/x-msgpack`
- __Request body__: JSON (or MessagePack) representation of the method arguments. Each method parameter names and arguments need to be a key-value pair in the JSON object. 
  - For an RPC method `def m(p1:T1, p2:T2, ...)`, the request body will have the structrure of `{"p1":(json representation of T1), "p2":(json representation of T2}, ...}`. For example, the request to the above `hello(request:HelloRequest)` method will require the following JSON body:
```json
{"request":{"name":"leo"}}
```
- __Accept__: "application/json" (default) or "application/x-msgpack"
- __Response body__: JSON (or MessagePack) representation of the method return type: 
```json
{"message":"..."}
```
-__Http Status__
  - 200 (Ok) for successful responses.
  - 400 (Bad Request) if some request parameters are invalid.
