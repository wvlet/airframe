## 22.6.0

This version extends Scala 3 support for additional modules, including config, fluentd, http, jdbc, jmx, launcher, rx-html, sql, parquet. 

From this version, we drop the support of Java 8 for improving the maintainability and for adopting new Java client of JDK11, which can be used without any additional dependencies.
airframe-http added a new standard http client implementation (Http.client.newSync/AsyncClient), which works both in JVM and Scala.js.

## 22.5.0

This version changes the behavior of AirSpec in order to support [async testing](https://wvlet.org/airframe/docs/airspec#async-testing) for tests that return `Future[_]` values. With async testing, you don't need to wait the completion of `Future[_]` objects in your test cases. This is especially useful when you need to await network responses in your Scala and Scala.js test code.  

If you have tests that acquire resources around Future, you may see unexpected execution test order due to this change. To properly acquire and release resources for async testing, consider using newly added methods `Control.withResourceAsync(resource)` and `wvlet.airframe.control.Resource[A].wrapFuture`.

This version also adds `wvlet.airframe.http.RPCStatus` error code, which will be the standard error reporting method in Airframe RPC. In the upcoming Airframe versions, you can use `RPCStatus.newException(...)` to propagate RPC server-side errors into clients in the form of `wvlet.airframe.http.RPCException`.

This version upgrades to [Scala.js 1.10.0](https://www.scala-js.org/news/2022/04/04/announcing-scalajs-1.10.0/) to address a security vulnerability [CVE-2022-28355](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28355) found in java.util.UUID.randomUUID() implementation of Scala.js. If UUID.randomUUID() is used for generting publicly visible IDs, generated IDs were preditable in the former Scala.js versions.   
Similarily, airframe-ulid for Scala.js is fixed to use SecureRandom to avoid generating predictable ULID values.

## 21.12.1

This release is for upgrading to Scala.js 1.8.0 and using a safer version of logback-core 1.2.8, which removes JNDI/JDBC related codei [LOGBACK-1591](https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1591). Note that it's a different issue from the log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). logback-core is used inside airframe-log for rotating log files and airframe-log doesn't use any logback configuration file, which can be a target of JNDI lookup security hole.

## 21.5.4

This is a minor bug fix release. We've found airframe-surface for Scala 3 still has several issues, which may cause errors in Airframe DI.

- airframe-di: Fixes macro-compilation errors by using only inline methods for Scala 3 ([#1673](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/1673)) [[db2cdf690](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/commit/db2cdf690)]
- airspec: Show deprecation warning messages for scalaJSSupport usage.
- airframe-json: Deprecate JSON query (path / to).value syntax. Use (path / to).getValue instead becuase .value can be ambiguous in Scala 3. 
- internal: Migrating test codes for Scala 3 ([#1672](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/1672)) [[76943cfd0](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/commit/76943cfd0)]

## 21.5.3

AirSpec, a testing library for Scala, now supports Scala 3.0.0! From this version, AirSpec only supports `test(...) { ... }` syntax, and deprecates using public functions as test cases. See also [AirSpec documentation](https://wvlet.org/airframe/docs/airspec).

## 21.5.2

This is a minor bug fix release for AirSpec and surfce.

- airframe-surface, codec: Add BigInt, BigInteger support ([#1666](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/1666)) [[8f99f5272](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/commit/8f99f5272)]

## 21.5.1

### Major Changes

- From this version, Airframe DI for Scala 3.0.0 is available. For Scala 3, Airframe DI only supports constructor injection. We will deprecate in-trait injection support in upcoming versions. For more details, see also [airframe-di migraiton plan](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/1649).
- AirSpec deprecates function-style test specs and only uses `test("...") { ... }` syntax. This version shows warning messages if you are still using public functions as test cases. This test support will be removed from the next version of AirSpec. This is [a necessary step toward supporting Scala 3](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/1659).

## 20.12.2

### Scala 3 support (experimenal)

airframe-log, airframe-surface are experimentally supporting Scala 3.0.0-M3. We are now working on Scala 3 support for Airframe DI. The progress can be tracked at [#1077](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/1077). We have found one blocking issue that needs a fix at Scala 3 side [#10931](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/10931). After this issue is resolved, porting other Airframe modules, including AirSpec, to Scala 3 would not be so difficult for us.

## 0.49
 - __Important__: `bind[X]`, `bind[X].to[Y]`, etc. now use singleton bindings by default. This is because most of the use cases expect binding
 the same objects to traits. If you need to explicitly instantiate objects for each binding, use `bindInstance[X]` or `bind[X].toInstanceOf[Y]`.
 - Add a handy method to start a session and build an object: `Design.build[A]{ a => ... }`.

## 0.34
 - No major change in terms of features, API.
 - Airframe now uses [sbt-dnyver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) for auto versioning.
 - For each commit in the main branch, you can find a snapshot version from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/wvlet/airframe/
   - For example, [airframe-log_2.12/0.33.1+12-682c4e07-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/wvlet/airframe/airframe-log_2.12/0.33.1+12-682c4e07-SNAPSHOT/), means that this version is based on the version `0.33.1` and `12` commits away from the previous version tag, and using git revision `682c4e07`.
 - The release versions will be like `0.34` as usual and available from Maven central.

 - Interface change: `Surface.of[X]` to `surface.of[X]`.
   - This is for providing different implementations of Surface for ScalaJVM and Scala.js.
 - Fixed an issue when tagged type is used inside constructor parameters.
 - Fixed an issue that lifecycle hooks are wrongly called when debug level logging is used.
 - Merged wvlet-config as airframe-config. This module is useful for creating configuration objects from YAML file.

 - Split Travis build process for the matrix of Scala 2.12/2.11, ScalaJVM/JS
