## 19.11.0

**Major changes**:

- Added Scala.js support for airframe-codec. Now you can build http servers (Scala JVM) and client pages (Scala.js) that interact together through airframe-codec.

## 0.49
 - __Important__: `bind[X]`, `bind[X].to[Y]`, etc. now use singleton bindings by default. This is because most of the use cases expect binding
 the same objects to traits. If you need to explicitly instantiate objects for each binding, use `bindInstance[X]` or `bind[X].toInstanceOf[Y]`.

## 0.34
 - No major change in terms of features, API.
 - Airframe now uses [sbt-dnyver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) for auto versioning.
 - For each commit in the master branch, you can find a snapshot version from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/wvlet/airframe/
   - For example, [airframe-log_2.12/0.33.1+12-682c4e07-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/wvlet/airframe/airframe-log_2.12/0.33.1+12-682c4e07-SNAPSHOT/), means that this version is based on the version `0.33.1` and `12` commits away from the previous version tag, and using git revision `682c4e07`.

 - Interface change: `Surface.of[X]` to `surface.of[X]`.
   - This is for providing different implementations of Surface for ScalaJVM and Scala.js.
 - Fixed an issue when tagged type is used inside constructor parameters.
 - Fixed an issue that lifecycle hooks are wrongly called when debug level logging is used.
 - Merged wvlet-config as airframe-config. This module is useful for creating configuration objects from YAML file.
