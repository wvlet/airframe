## 0.39
 - Add a unified scaladoc for all modules

## 0.38

## 0.37
 - [airframe-tablet](airframe-tablet.html) Add play-json based JSONCodec to enable transformation between JSON <-> MessagePack <-> Object.

## 0.35
 - Minor fixes to project strucutres and build scripts.

## 0.34
 - No major change in terms of features, API.
 - Airframe now uses [sbt-dnyver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) for auto versioning.
 - For each commit in the master branch, you can find a snapshot version from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/wvlet/airframe/
   - For example, [airframe-log_2.12/0.33.1+12-682c4e07-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/wvlet/airframe/airframe-log_2.12/0.33.1+12-682c4e07-SNAPSHOT/), means that this version is based on the version `0.33.1` and `12` commits away from the previous version tag, and using git revision `682c4e07`.
 - The release versions will be like `0.34` as usual and available from Maven central.

## 0.33
 - Add [airframe-jdbc](airframe-jdbc.html), a reusable JDBC connection pool implementation.  

## 0.32
 - Fix ObjectCodec for map type value [#131](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/pull/131)

## 0.31
 - Support recursive types

## 0.30
 - *airframe-metrics*: Add support for Scala.js (DataSize, ElapsedTime)
 - Add ElapsedTime for succinct duration representation

## 0.29
 - Add airframe-codec, a [MessgePack](https://msgpack.org)-based schema-on-read data transcoder.

## 0.28
 - Add support for Scala 2.13.0-M2

## 0.27
 - aiframe-config: Fixes nested case class binding [#108](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/issues/110)
 - Dropped support of Scala.js + Scala 2.11 combination. Scala.js libraries will support only Scala 2.12 (or higher) in upcoming releases

## 0.26
 - Add an initial version of [airframe-tablet](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/tree/master/tablet), a [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) based data transcoder

## 0.25
 - **airframe-log** Upgrade the internal log rotation library to logback-core 1.2.3
 - Upgrade to Scala 2.12.4 and sbt 1.0.3. 

## 0.24
 - Add [airframe-metrics](airframe-metrics.html)

## 0.23
 - Moved to `org.wvlet.airframe` organization because Airframe will have more modules in future.
 - Added airframe-spec (a common library for testing airframe modules)

## 0.22
 - Add Logger.clearAllHandlers to clean-up existing log handlers set by third-party libraries
 - Apply scalafmt code style 

## 0.21
 - Add [airframe-opts](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/tree/master/airframe-opts) command line parser.

## 0.20
 - Migrated [airframe-log](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/tree/master/airframe-log) from [wvlet-log](https://github.com/wvlet/log) because 
these are often commonly used.

## 0.19
 - Add [airframe-jmx](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/tree/master/airframe-jmx) to expose object parameters through JMX

## 0.18
 - Add beforeShutdown, onInject lifecycle hooks
 - Support `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` JSR-250 annotations (Scala.js is not supported)
 - Fix to call onInit, onStart only once for singletons

## 0.17
 - Upgrade to Scala 2.12.3, Scala.js 0.6.19
 - Add Design.add
 - Fix a bug, onStart lifecycle hook is not called when a session is already started
 - Fix to use default constructor argument values for constructor bindings
   - Note: Scala.js does not support default parameter binding yet
 
## 0.16
 - Support reading Map type values in YamlReader (airframe config)

## 0.15
 - Surface will be gererated by using runtime-type information. This improves the compilation speed in Scala JVM projects.
   - Scala.js version still uses compile-time surface generation
 - Interface change: `Surface.of[X]` to `surface.of[X]`.
   - This is for providing different implementations of Surface for ScalaJVM and Scala.js.
 - Fixed an issue when tagged type is used inside constructor parameters.
 - Fixed an issue that lifecycle hooks are wrongly called when debug level logging is used.
 - Merged wvlet-config as airframe-config. This module is useful for creating configuration objects from YAML file.

## 0.14
 - [Surface](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe/tree/master/surface) is now a part of Airframe
 - Added RuntimeSurface for the convenience of creating Surface from runtime-type information (reflect.universe.Type)
 - Added ObjectBuilder to build objects from Surface information

## 0.13
 - Add tagged binding support

## 0.12
 - Airframe is now refrection-free.
   - Using a reflection free [Surface](https://github.com/wvlet/surface) instaed of [ObjectSchema](https://github.com/wvlet/object-schema)
   - Cyclic dependencies now can be found at compile-time thanks to Surface
 - Initial Scala.js support
 - Split Travis build process for the matrix of Scala 2.12/2.11, ScalaJVM/JS
 - Add shortcut for life cycle events: bind[X].onInit/onStart/onShutdown
 - Deprecated tagged type binding. Instead you can use type alias bind[(type alias)].
 - Deprecated @PreDestroy, @PostConstruct lifecycle binding because it complicates the order of life cycle hooks when mixed in
 - Deprecated passing Session as a class parameter or method return value. 
 - Simplified Scala macro codes

## 0.10
 - Session now implements AutoClosable
 - Add Design.withSession{ session => ... } to close Session at ease 

## 0.9
 - Add Scala 2.12 support

## 0.8
 - Split the project into two sub projects: airframe and airframe-macro. However, you only need airframe.jar for using Airframe.
 - Improved the performance by replacing run-time code generation to compile-time code generation #25
 - Upgrade to wvlet-log 1.0 
 - Upgrade wvlet-obj 0.26 (support type aliases)
 - Allow binding to type aliases

## 0.7
 - Fix lifecycle management of objects generated by bindSingleton

## 0.6
 - Add bindSingleton[X]

## 0.5 
 - Fix a bug in FILO order init/shutdown when objects are singleton
 - Add toProvider/toSingletonProvider/toEagerSingletonProvider
 - Add Design.remove[X]

## 0.4 
 - Improved binding performance
 - Fix FIFO lifecycle hook executor
 - Improved injection logging

## 0.3 
 - Support bind(ObjectType).toXXX 

## 0.2
 - Add lifecycle manageer
 - Reorganize Session, Design classes
 - Test coverage improvement
 - Depreacted Design.build[X]. Use Design.newSession.build[X]

## 0.1
 - Migrated from wvlet-inject
