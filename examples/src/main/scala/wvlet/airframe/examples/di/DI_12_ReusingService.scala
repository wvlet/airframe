/**
  * If you have services that have some resources (e.g., database connections, http clients, thread managers, etc.),
  * define trait XXXService and add lifecycle hooks to the trait to properly release such resources.
  *
  * Service traits defined in this manner will be reusable components that can safely manage your resources upon session termination.
  *
  * The lifecycle of resources will be managed in First-In Last-Out (FILO) order. Even if you use these service traits
  * multiple times, shutdown hooks will be called only once per the resource.
